## Dataset
The dataset that I have chosen is the [immunization of children](https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/immunization/) dataset from the UNICEF website. This dataset gives us an idea of the immunization coverage by antigen across the world among children since last 30 years. It covers vaccines such as BCG(Tuberculosis), DTP1(Diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus), HEP b(Hepatitis), IPV(Polio), etc. It gives us the vaccination coverage percentage among different countries. Using this data, we can visualize and filter out the countries whose children are below the target coverage percentage and take necessary actions to vaccinate them. We can also educate those countries to create awareness of the importance of being vaccinated. Since vaccination is crucial to prevent the outbreak of diseases, through this dataset, we can help millions of children worldwide get vaccinated and lead healthy lives.

## Data science book
**R and data mining: Examples and Case Studies**
**Author: Yanchang Zhao** 
[“R and data mining: Examples and Case Studies”](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Zhao_R_and_data_mining.pdf), is a beginner-friendly book that introduces the concepts of using R for data mining, and training ML models like KNN, Regression, Random Forest, and Clustering in real-world scenarios. It also has very good intuition on how to use Time series models forecasting. And, finally, the last two chapters focus a lot on unstructured datasets like retrieving info for them using algorithms like clustering and basic NLP models. There is also a section that talks about Network analysis, a good application could be the detection of toxicity in social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. 

I found this book interesting because it follows a very practical approach to teaching the concepts and uses many real-world datasets. The book does not feel rushed and is very easy to follow through and understand well. Also, there are many examples analyzed in depth for better understanding. I think it’s the perfect book for someone transitioning into R to learn data mining techniques. As I have started my masters in data analytics, learning R is of paramount importance and this book serves my purpose well.
